Your project is an educational platform designed to provide students with structured learning materials, organized into five subjects. Each subject is divided into five units, and for every unit, there are associated quizzes, topics, and YouTube video links to supplement the learning process. The quizzes allow students to test their knowledge of each unit and track their progress, while the topics break down the content into digestible sections for easier understanding. The integration of YouTube video links for each topic offers students a visual and interactive way to enhance their comprehension through tutorials, explanations, or demonstrations.The platform is accessible only to students who have been provided with passwords, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content. From a technical perspective, the project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end is responsible for delivering an intuitive and user-friendly interface where students can navigate through subjects, access quizzes, and view video links. On the back-end, the system manages the database of users, content, and access controls, ensuring secure storage of information and smooth communication between the front and back ends. This combination of front-end and back-end development ensures a seamless, secure, and efficient learning experience for students.
